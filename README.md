**Building production-ready DL solutions for continuous success using the latest techniques in Python**

## What is this book about?
Unlock the limitless potential of deep learning to solve real-world challenges, automate processes, and revolutionize industries. Crafting effective and consistently successful deep learning solutions can be challenging, but this book is the practical guide you need to conquer this domain. The book dives into every aspect of the deep learning life cycle, from planning and data preparation to model deployment and governance. With a focus on real-world scenarios, you’ll acquire the expertise to create, deploy, and manage advanced deep learning solutions. Learn how to work with image, audio, text, and video data using deep learning architectures. Optimize and evaluate your deep learning models objectively while addressing crucial issues like bias, fairness, adversarial attacks, and model transparency. Harness the power of AI platforms to streamline the deep learning life cycle. Leverage Python libraries and frameworks such as Pytorch, ONNX, Catalyst, MLFlow, captum, Nvidia Triton, Prometheus, Grafana to execute efficient deep learning architectures, optimize model performance, and streamline deployment processes. Delve into the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) solutions for a wide array of applications and challenges.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automate the design of ANNs
* Use RNNs, CNNs, BERT, transformers, and more to build your model
* Deal with multi-modal data drift in production environment
* Evaluate the quality and bias of your models
* Explore techniques to protect your model from adversarial attacks
* Get to grips with deploying a model with DataRobot AutoML
